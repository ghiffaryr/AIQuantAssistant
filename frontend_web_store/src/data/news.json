If you wish to learn about more, head straight to 20 Least Productive Countries in the World.\nThe increase in worker productivity has been the main driver of the US economy and has raised real wages. A McKinsey analysis released on February 16 stated that since 2005, the US has had below-average productivity growth, with an average of just 1.4%. This is due to a decreased labor participation rate.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, US nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased by 0.3%, a significant slowdown compared to the previous quarter's growth of 3.5%. This marks a lower-than-average performance, as the long-term average for US labor productivity growth stands at 2.17%. The annual average labor productivity growth in the US nonfarm business sector was 1.2% in 2023 which is a modest improvement from -1.9% in 2022 but still below the historical average.\nManufacturing sector productivity in the US has been sluggish, with an annual average decline of 0.8% in 2023. However, there are variations within the sector, with durable manufacturing experiencing a 2.0% productivity drop, while nondurable manufacturing saw a 2.6% increase. Since the pandemic, US labor productivity has grown at a robust annual pace of 1.5%, outperforming other advanced economies where productivity growth has been scant or negative.\nWhen it comes to the most productive companies in the world, Amazon, PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), among many others, can’t be left behind. Amazon’s e-commerce platform and vast product offerings have made it a dominant force in online retail, capturing a staggering 37.8% of all online retail sales in the U.S. One of Amazon's most significant contributions to the global economy is its role as a job creator. As of mid-2023, Amazon employed over 1.6 million people worldwide, making it the fourth-largest U.S. company by market capitalization. Additionally, Amazon's investments have supported nearly 1.6 million indirect jobs in fields like construction and hospitality. In Q1 2024, their net sales increased 13% year-over-year to $143.3 billion, exceeding expectations and net income more than tripled to $10.43 billion or $0.98 per share, surpassing analyst estimates of $0.84.\nSimilarly, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a leading technology platform. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) operates a vast global network connecting 426 million active accounts across approximately 200 markets as of December 31, 2023. Since 2013, PayPal has facilitated $24.2 billion in access to small business capital through over 1.2 million loans and cash advances, including $3.6 billion in 2021 alone. In 2021, PayPal completed the allocation of its $535 million commitment to racial equity and social justice and pledged $108 million towards investments supporting the economic empowerment of women and girls. Their revenue reached $7.7 billion in Q1 2024, up 9% year-over-year and the operating income surged by 17% to $1.168 billion.\nLastly, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also one of the most innovative and productive companies. The company has committed to investing $430 billion in the US over five years, creating 20,000 new jobs across the country. In Q1 2024 Apple reported total revenues of $119.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year and their active installed device base surpassed 2.2 billion, an all-time high.\nFor our methodology, we have ranked the least productive countries in the world based on estimated GDP per capita in 2023. For the accuracy of data, we relied on Ilostat.\nGDP per Hour Worked: $1\nBurundi tops the list for being the least productive country in the world. Burundi's labor productivity is forecasted to be only US$0.29 in 2024. Burundi is a low-income economy, with 80% of the population employed in the agricultural sector. In 2023, the economic growth accelerated to 2.7%, compared with 1.8% in 2022. The economic growth is projected at 3.8% in 2024. Inflation in the country averaged 27.1% in 2023, compared with 18.8% a year earlier.

        "texts": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) investors endured a torrid time in the first four months of 2024 as shares of the tech giant fell 8%, while the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index gained 6% over the same time.\nThe company's stagnant growth and a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) lawsuit explain why investor confidence in Apple stock was low during this time. The good news is that the company is finally receiving some love from the stock market. Shares of the company were up more than 12% in May, driven by a solid set of results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, which were released May 2.\nLet's look at the reasons Apple regained its mojo and determine whether investors should consider buying this tech stock in anticipation of further gains.\nApple's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was down 4% from the year-ago period to $90.8 billion, driven mainly by a drop in iPhone sales. The company sold $46 billion worth of iPhones in the quarter that ended in March, down from $51.3 billion in the same period last year.\nApple's bottom line increased by a penny to $1.53 per share. The company's record revenue of $23.9 billion from the services business, which grew 14% year over year, helped support its bottom line.\nHowever, Apple beat Wall Street's expectations of $1.50 per share in earnings on $90 billion in revenue. What's more, the company expects to return to growth in the current quarter, with its revenue forecasted to increase in the low single digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple is forecasting double-digit growth in the services business and iPad revenue.\nGiven that the company gets half of its revenue from selling iPhones, it won't be surprising to see sales of Apple's smartphones increasing once again. After all, the global smartphone market reported 7.8% year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2024, following a 3% decline last year, according to IDC. The market research firm is forecasting a 2.8% increase in smartphone sales this year, but there is a good chance the market could clock stronger growth thanks to AI-enabled smartphones.\nIDC estimates that 170 million AI smartphones could be shipped in 2024, accounting for 15% of the overall market. According to Counterpoint Research, that number is expected to head higher impressively in the future, with shipments forecasted to jump 4x in the next four years. More importantly, Counterpoint is expecting Apple to become the leading player in the AI smartphone market in 2025.\nA recent report from Apple Insider suggests the smartphone giant is set to dive into the AI smartphone market this year with iOS 18. The company's next-generation software is expected to help users create transcripts from voice memos and the Notes application. Meanwhile, the Messages app and Safari browser are expected to get an AI-powered summarization feature that will give users a summary of the contents of a webpage or get a gist of important parts of messages.\nOther sources suggest Apple is set to bring a comprehensive suite of AI features to its devices, such as an advanced iteration of Siri on the Watch, generating emojis automatically based on what users are typing, and a potential chatbot. Considering Apple is the second-largest player in the smartphone market, with a share of just over 17%, the company is in a nice position to capitalize on the growth of AI smartphones.\nAs such, there is a good chance its iPhone revenue could start increasing again once it starts integrating more AI-focused features.\nWedbush Securities estimates that Apple's upcoming AI-enabled smartphone could drive a solid upgrade cycle. The firm also forecasts that AI features would create an additional monetization opportunity for the company's services business. As a result, Wedbush upgraded its price target on Apple stock to $275 from $250, which points toward a jump of 45% from current levels.\nThe stock currently has a median 12-month price target of $202, as per 49 analysts covering it, which points toward a 6% upside from current levels. However, analysts are raising their growth expectations from Apple following its latest report. Over the last 30 days, 28 analysts have boosted their earnings expectations from Apple for the current fiscal year, while 26 have raised the same for the next fiscal year.\nThis is evident from the chart below:\nThis potential improvement in Apple's earnings growth could be rewarded with more gains. That's why investors can consider buying this tech stock before it starts soaring. Apple is available at 29 times trailing earnings right now, representing a discount to the Nasdaq-100's trailing earnings multiple of 31 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks).\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.
